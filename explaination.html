        Renderer: WEBGL2
        <br>
        <br>
        Description:
        <br>
        The renderer is of an MousePad with an RGB strip around it.
        <br>
        <br>
        How the MousePad is rendered:
        <br>
        For rendering the texture on the mousepad itself I have created 8 polygons.
        <br>
        1 for the lower left texture.
        1 for the upper right texutre.
        3 polygons each forming the two textures in the middle.
        <br>
        I have assigned the respective color for each polygon.
        <br>
        <br>
        How the strip is created:
        <br>
        I have created an algorithm that starts from the upper left vertex of the mousepad moving right then down then
        left then up and during this movement it is essentially creating a small set of triangles around the mousepad which have colors assigned to them.
        <br>
        <br>
        How the strip is animated:
        <br>
        For each of the modes I have simply created different functions that assign colors to the triangles around the mousepad. For each animation I have added a sleep command in the render function.
        <br>
        <br>
        Breathe:
        <br>
        Changes the color of all strips around the mousepad from black to color in 4 stages.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rainbow:
        <br>
        Changes the left strip, then assings the same color to botom strip, then right strip then top strip while also
        changing colors of previous strips.
        <br>
        <br>
        Cycle:
        <br>
        Changes color around mousepad in cycle fashion.
        <br>
        <br>
        Disco:
        <br>
        Changes color around mousepad in fast motion.
        <br>
        <br>
        Speed Bar:
        <br>
        Changes the value passed to sleep function.
